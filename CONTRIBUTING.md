# Contributing

## How to Contribute
To contribute:
- Create a fork of the repository. Name it with a variation like ```fork-XediX```, ```XediX-fork```, ```XediX-forked```, but **not** ```XediX```.
- Make your changes in the forked repository.
- Write a pull request with a description that is **at least 20 characters long**. 
 - If the description is too short, the PR review process will fail.
 - You are allowed to use AI for the description, but it must be clear and true.
- If your PR is a work in progress, prefix the title with ```[WIP]``` to skip the review process.
- If you believe this is a high-priority PR or a bug fix, mention @mostypc123 somewhere in the description.

## PR Guidelines
- Aim to modify fewer than 20 files in a single PR.
- If your PR involves breaking changes, explicitly mention "breaking change" in the description.

## PR Review Process
- We use a GitHub Action for automated PR reviews.
- The action checks:
 - PR description length
 - Number of modified files
 - Automatic labeling based on description content
- PRs prefixed with ```[WIP]``` will automatically bypass the review process.
