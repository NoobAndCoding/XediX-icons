# Security Policy
This app does not have any security problems, because in fact you can edit offline, so there is not a possibility of having security problems.

**But**:
- If you think something is **unsecure**
- You think some keys were **leaked**
- Or anything that seems off **about the security**:

you can follow these steps:
- Write a report here: https://github.com/mostypc123/XediX/security/advisories?state=Triage
- Assing me using @ to get attention.
- If you can, fix it with a pull request.
