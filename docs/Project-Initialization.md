This is a very important thing if you want to make bigger projects in XediX. Because we all know you will not be working in the directory of XediX :).

## How
Go to Menu > Project > Init Project to start a new project in your directory. I also recommend running the other options (Git & Python Init).
## Why
XediX would not work if you do not init at least XediX.
