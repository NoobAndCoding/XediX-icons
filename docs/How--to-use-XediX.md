# Installation
## Windows, v4.1.alpha.5+
Basically the same as alpha.5, but there is not a file put in there by mistake :).

## Windows, v4.1.alpha.5
This release contains a zipfile with all the files, but do NOT use the xedixSetup.exe file. Use the main.exe file instead.

## Windows 11

**If there is not a setup file provided, there is probably a portable version instead.**

To install XediX on Windows 11, follow these steps:

### 1. Download the Latest Version
- Go to the [XediX GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mostypc123/XediX/releases) page.
- Download the latest setup file for Windows 11.
- If the release is a pre-release, you can still take it as a stable version, it is just not complete.

### 2. Run the Setup File
- Once the download is complete, run the setup file to begin the installation process.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to install XediX on your computer.

### 3. Start Using XediX
- After installation, you can open XediX directly from the start menu or your application folder, depending on your operating system.

That’s it! You’re ready to start coding in Python with XediX.

# Using XediX
