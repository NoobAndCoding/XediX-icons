# 4.1.alpha.2

The new prerelease adds simple extensions, so you definitively want to know how it works. Just to note that this version is not deployed.
For first, you will need to open the source code in a text editor that can run codes. 

### How to add something to the menubar?
Open the `extension_menubar.py` file. In the `main()`function, write the code to add something to the menubar. **You might not need to import the libraries separately in that file.**

### How to add code straight to the `TextEditor` class?
Open the `extension_mainclass.py` file. In the `main()`function, write the code to add something to the main class. **You might not need to import the libraries separately in that file.**

### How to add code straight to the `main` function?
Open the `extension_mainfn.py` file. In the `main()`function, write the code to add something to the main function. **You might not need to import the libraries separately in that file.**
